# CretneyMegan.Final.Trading
You are first shown what stocks are currently in your account.
You are then given a choice to sell or buy stocks

The automatic trading bot runs about every 5 minutes.
It first checks if you have an AAPL stock that you can sell. If you have one to sell it checks if you have made over $100 from the stock, if so sell it.
Next it checks if you have lost over $100 from the stock and if so sells it.

If you do not currently have an AAPL stock it uses yahoo finance to check how the stock is doing. If the PE ratio is below 50 it buys the stock for you.
